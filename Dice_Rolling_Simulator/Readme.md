### Description
The dice rolling simulator is a simple application built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The simulator mimics the action of rolling a dice, providing a random outcome between 1 and 6 each time the user interacts with the interface. This application is useful for games, educational purposes, or simply for fun.

### Game_Logic

- Initialization: When the program starts, it initializes the main window using Tkinter.
- Dice Roll: A function generates a random number between 1 and 6 using Python's random module.
- Display: The result of the dice roll is displayed on the GUI, typically as a number or a graphical representation of a dice face.
- Interaction: The user can roll the dice by clicking a button on the GUI, which triggers the dice roll function.

### FEATURES
Random Dice Roll: Uses the random.randint(1, 6) function to generate a number between 1 and 6.
Graphical Interface: A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, making it easy to interact with the simulator.
Roll Button: A button that the user clicks to roll the dice.
Display Area: Shows the result of the dice roll, either as a numeric value or a visual representation.

### Tech Stack Overview

The dice rolling simulator utilizes a combination of technologies and libraries to create a functional and interactive application. Below is a breakdown of the tech stack used:

#### **Programming Language:**
- **Python**

#### **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
- **Tkinter** 

#### **Libraries and Modules:**
- **Random**

#### **Development Environment:**
- **IDLE**
- **VS Code**
#### **Version Control:**
- **Git**
- **GitHub**
### Example of Tech Stack in Action
1. **Python**: The logic of the dice roll is implemented in Python using simple functions and conditional statements.
2. **Tkinter**: Used to create the main window, buttons, and labels that make up the user interface.
3. **Random Module**: Utilized within the dice roll function to generate a random number between 1 and 6 each time the user clicks the roll button.
4. **Git and GitHub**: The code is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub, making it easy to share and collaborate with others.

### Installation Instructions
1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with Python, so no additional installation is required.
3. **Clone the Repository**: If the project is hosted on GitHub, clone the repository using Git.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
4. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory and run the Python script.
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   python dice_simulator.py
   ```
