I have created a Chrome extension which works on all Chromium-based browsers for stress relief when coding.<br>
- Link = <a href="https://github.com/iamrahulmahato/master-web-development/tree/main/projects/Relaxio">here</a>
<hr>
<h2>Features:</h2>

- Motivational Quotes on a single click,
- Meow! button which fetches random funny cat photographs and GIFs,
- A simple number guesser game and
- A custom tailormade collection of LoFi beats for concentration.
<hr>
This Chrome extension works using the Manifest feature of chromium browsers, Html, CSS and JavaScript, and using various APIs (Quotable for quotes, TheCatApi for cat images, Music from FreeSoundLibrary).
<hr>

<h2>How to Run?</h2>

- Download as zip file
- In your browser extensions page, enable 'Developer Mode'
- Click on the 'Load Unpacked" button and select this zip file.
- Enjoy!
