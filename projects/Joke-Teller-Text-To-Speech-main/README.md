Its a compound website which is a combination of joke telling api and web speech api. 🌐

I learned how to fetch data from the apis.
I used async await in this.
While making this , I learned about some windows speechSynthesis fucntions like getVoices() ,onvoicechanged().🔊

This website may not work on some mobile devices as it uses webspeechapi which is not supported in every browsers..Try to open it in laptop 💻...There is a high chances it will work there.
Moreover ,you can use the joke telling api in every devices..

I have made this website in such a way that you can send some text and it will convert that text into audio or when you click on "tell me a joke" ,then it speaks it out loud.📢
