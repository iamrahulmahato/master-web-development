## Gameplay 🎮

Players take turns rolling a virtual dice:

-   If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current points and pass the dice to the next player.
-   Rolling any other number adds to the player's current score.
-   Players can choose to "Hold" to save their current score, adding it to their total score.

The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the winning score.
