    <h1>Civil Law</h1>
    <p>
      Civil law encompasses a wide range of legal issues that do not involve criminal offenses. It deals with disputes between individuals, organizations, or entities seeking compensation or resolution for various grievances.
    </p>

      Common areas of civil law include contract disputes, personal injury cases, family law matters such as divorce and child custody, real estate disputes, and more. In civil law cases, the goal is to provide remedies, such as monetary compensation or specific performance, to the injured party.
