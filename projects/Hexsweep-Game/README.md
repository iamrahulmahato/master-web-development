# 🎮 Hex Sweep Game

Welcome to Hex Sweep, a fun and challenging Minesweeper-inspired game! 🕹️

## 🎯 Game Description

Hex Sweep is a twist on the classic Minesweeper game. Instead of a rectangular grid, you'll navigate through a hexagonal grid, searching for hidden mines. Your goal is to uncover all the hexagons that don't contain mines without triggering any of the mines. Can you sweep the board clean without detonating a mine? 💥

1. **Objective:** Uncover all hexagons without hitting a mine.
2. **Controls:**
   - **Left-click:** Uncover a hexagon.
   - **Right-click:** Place a flag on a hexagon to mark it as a suspected mine.
3. **Rules:**
   - If you uncover a hexagon with a mine, the game is over. 💣
