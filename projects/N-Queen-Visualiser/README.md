# N-Queens Visualiser

Welcome to the **N-Queens Visualiser**! This web application allows you to visualize the classic N-Queens problem, where the objective is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This is achieved by ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
