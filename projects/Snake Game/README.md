## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the arrow keys or WASD.
- **Food Collection**: Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.
- **Game Over Handling**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls, turning the board red for 2 seconds before resetting.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
