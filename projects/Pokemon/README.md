This game challenges your memory skills with Pokémon cards, where you must remember which cards you've clicked. 

The game resets your score if you click the same card twice, and your best score is tracked!

How to Play:
The game displays a grid of Pokémon cards.
Click on a card that you haven't clicked before to score points.
But be careful! If you click the same card twice, your score resets to 0.
Try to score as high as possible before making a mistake. Your highest score will be tracked!
