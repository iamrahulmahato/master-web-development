### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or using the project, please refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: 
   - Ensure that all required dependencies are installed with compatible versions. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall dependencies.
   - Check for peer dependency warnings, and if needed, update your dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.

2. **Setup Issues**: 
   - Double-check that you have followed the setup instructions correctly. Missing environment variables or misconfigurations are common issues.
   - Ensure that you are using the correct Node.js version (check `.nvmrc` or `package.json` for version details). If you're not, you can switch versions using `nvm use`.

3. **Platform-Specific Errors**: 
   - On Windows, make sure you have proper permissions to execute scripts. You might need to run the terminal or IDE as an administrator.
   - On Linux/macOS, ensure that all necessary permissions are set for running scripts with `chmod +x`.
   - If you're facing file path issues, ensure your terminal or IDE is running in the correct directory by checking with `pwd` (Linux/macOS) or `cd` (Windows).

4. **Common Errors**:
   - **"Module not found"**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to make sure all required modules are installed.
   - **"Permission denied"**: On Linux/macOS, you might need to use `sudo` for certain commands.
   - **"EADDRINUSE"**: If you see this error, a port is already in use. Use `lsof -i :PORT_NUMBER` to check and kill the process.

5. **Debugging & Logging**: 
   - For more detailed error logs, run the application with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to `*` (e.g., `DEBUG=* npm start`).
   - If using Node.js, add `--inspect` to enable the built-in debugger (e.g., `node --inspect index.js`).
